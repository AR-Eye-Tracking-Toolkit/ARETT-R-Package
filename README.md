# ARETT R Package: Augmented Reality Eye Tracking Toolkit for Head Mounted Displays

This is a R package which contains analysis scripts for eye tracking data acquired using ARETT and the Microsoft HoloLens 2.

As the gaze data generated by ARETT consists of three dimensional gaze information in an AR environment it differs from traditional eye trackers and is not supported by other R packages. This package implements the I-DT, I-VT and I-AOI fixation algorithms for this new data paradigm.

## Supported Functions

The package implements three offline fixation identification algorithms together with two pre- and two post-processing functions. Details about the implemented algorithms can be found in the included [documentation](#documentation) and the accompanying [publication](#reference).

**Pre-processing:**
* Gap fill
* Noise reduction

**Fixation identification:**
* Identification by velocity threshold (I-VT)
* Identification by dispersion threshold (I-DT)
* Identification by area of interest (I-AOI)

**Post-processing:**
* Merge adjacent fixations
* Discard short fixations


## Installation

Clone the git project to a local folder (or download all files), open a R session in the folder and run

```R
devtools::install()
```

## Documentation

All functions of the package are documented using [roxygen2](https://github.com/r-lib/roxygen2), available in the man folder and accessible after installation.

A snapshot of the documentation is also available in the [projects wiki](https://github.com/AR-Eye-Tracking-Toolkit/ARETT-R-Package/wiki), however this snapshot might not be up to date.
