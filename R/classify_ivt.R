#' Classify Fixations by Velocity Threshold
#'
#' @description
#' Classify each gaze point based on their velocities as calculated by \code{\link[arett]{calculate_velocity}}.
#'
#' @details
#' This is an implementation of the fixation identification by velocity threshold (I-VT) as documented in the \href{https://www.tobiipro.com/siteassets/tobii-pro/learn-and-support/analyze/how-do-we-classify-eye-movements/tobii-pro-i-vt-fixation-filter.pdf}{Tobii Pro I-VT fixation filter}.
#' It compares the velocity of each gaze point against the threshold and classifies the gaze point as saccade if the velocity is equal or above it.
#' Additionally it groups gaze points of the same classification into an event.
#'
#' The default velocity threshold is 100 degrees per second, as described by Tobii for their mobile eye trackers.
#' For stationary eye trackers the default threshold by Tobii is 30 degrees per second.
