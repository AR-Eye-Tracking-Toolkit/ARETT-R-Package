\description{
Classify each gaze point based on their velocities as calculated by \code{\link[arett]{calculate_velocity}}.

\details{
This is an implementation of the fixation identification by velocity threshold (I-VT) as documented in the \href{https://www.tobiipro.com/siteassets/tobii-pro/learn-and-support/analyze/how-do-we-classify-eye-movements/tobii-pro-i-vt-fixation-filter.pdf}{Tobii Pro I-VT fixation filter}.
It compares the velocity of each gaze point against the threshold and classifies the gaze point as saccade if the velocity is equal or above it.
Additionally it groups gaze points of the same classification into an event.

The default velocity threshold is 100 degrees per second, as described by Tobii for their mobile eye trackers.
For stationary eye trackers the default threshold by Tobii is 30 degrees per second.
